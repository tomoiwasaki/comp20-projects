Lab 7: Messages Revisited

All aspects of this lab have been implemented correctly - the code for the
"Messages" page was rewritten using jQuery, without modifying the given HTML
body, using for or while loops, or using document.getElementById(). The new,
rewritten page behaves exactly the same as the example that uses 
XMLHttpRequest. I spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment.
