Lab 5: The Epic Fail

Most aspects of this lab have been correctly implemented; the video plays 
correctly and the lyrics to Mariah Carey's "Emotion" are displayed line by 
line below the video, synchronized to the song. 

However, when trying to add to the Git repository via git on Terminal, I
somehow accidentally created a submodule called "annotation" instead. I
could not figure out how to remove the submodule, and subsequently I could 
not add the actual folder I had in my directory called "annotation" with my
3 files in it. I added the three files manually to GitHub, as I could not 
make it to office hours in time to receive help. Because of this, my
index.html, style.css, and README.md are not in a folder on GitHub.

I spent around 2.5 hours on this lab.
