COMP 20 Lab 4: Responsive Design

This lab creates a web page where a different part of the image "ralphy.gif"
is displayed when you resize the browser screen width. This was done by only by
editing the CSS file, responsive.css, and not editing the original index.html 
file that was given to us. All parts of this lab are correctly implemented: the
top left image of ralphy.gif is dispalyed if the browser screen width is
greater than 1400 pixels, the top right image of ralphy.gif is displayed if the
screen is greater than 1200 pixels but less than or equal to 1400 pixels, the
middle left image is displayed if the screen is greater than 1000 pixels but 
less than or equal to 1200 pixels, the middle right image is displayed if the
screen width is greater than 800 pixels and less than or equal to 1000 pixels,
the bottom left image is displayed if the screen width is greater than 600
pixels but less than 800 pixels, and the bottom right image is displayed if
the browser screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels. Around 3 hours
was spent on this assignment.
