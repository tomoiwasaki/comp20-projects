<h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of The Black Car Service</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Black Car Service is a transportation service that provides vehicles for passengers who need a ride, and passengers for vehicles looking to give rides. The Black Car Service uses the user's geolocation to retrieve the user's latitude, longitude, and whether or not they are a passenger looking for a ride or a vehicle looking to give rides. The service uses a Heroku web application, http://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/, and two mongoDB databases to store information about the user input, and whether or not they are a vehicle or a passenger. This page details the various security and privacy issues of The Black Car Service and their respective solutions. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p> Security and privacy issues were found using curl on the command line in Terminal. Through "black box" testing, potential problems were found through cross site scripting and database injection attacks without looking at the source code. Potential security issues were also found in the source code itself. </p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p>One main issue was found through cross site scripting, a method in which the attacker can change the content of a webpage through user input. With the same method, there was a potential risk found for an attacker to perform database injection, in which a vehicle username could be entered into the "passengers" database, as well as a case in which a passenger username could be displayed onto the main page of The Black Car Service twice. There was also an issue found in the source code itself, in which the code allows any site to send information to The Black Car Service, which could be a potential security hazard. </p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>
<p>Using curl in the terminal command line, through the HTTP POST method of this application (https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/submit), an attacker is easily able to use cross site scripting to change the HTML for the webpage and add code to redirect the page or display unwanted popups. For example, typing the phrase: &lt; curl --data "username=&lt;script&gt;window.location='https://google.com'&lt;/script&gt;&amp;lat=0&amp;lng=0" https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/submit &gt; into the terminal command line would input a passenger document in the database that has the code to redirect the page to Google.com. In this case, when a user visits https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com, and the particular document is meant to be displayed, the page instead redirects to Google.com. Pop-ups are also possible, with the line: &lt; curl --data "username=&lt;script&gt;alert('HELLO');&lt;/script&gt;&lat=0&lng=0" https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/submit &gt;
The severity of this issue is high - an attacker could easily use this method to redirect the user to a harmful website, add unwanted, harmful pop-ups to the screen, or perhaps post dangerous or misleading information on the webpage itself. This issue could be solved through the removal of special characters from user input, adding code such as: &lt; username = username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); &gt; under the HTTP POST '/submit' section of the source code. This way, the special characters needed to tamper with the HTML of the page would be erased. 

<br><br> In another vulnerability found using curl and cross site scripting through the HTTP POST method of this application (https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/submit), an attacker can also inject documents into the database that are either displayed incorrectly or injected into the wrong database. For example, typing the phrase: &lt; curl --data "username[$in]=JANET&lat=0&lng=0" https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com/submit &gt; into the terminal command line would input this document into the "passengers" database, and get displayed on The Black Car Service as a passenger on the webpage at https:fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com, despite the fact that JANET is a vehicle. Using the same technique, typing the phrase: &lt; curl --data "username[&ne]=mchow&lat=0&lng=0" https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com &gt; into the terminal command line would input this document into the passengers database, and get displayed on The Black Car Service webpage, even if mchow was previously entered into the database. This issue arises because the username is inputted into the database as mchow, even though it was entered differently with special characters. This can cause two of the same passenger usernames to show up twice on the display homepage. Through the same method, blank usernames, latitudes, and longitudes can be displayed onto the page with the terminal command: &lt; curl --data "username=$gt&lat=$gt&lng=$gt" https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com &gt;. The severity of this issue is medium - wrong displays of vehicles on the webpage, duplicate usernames, and blank information could all be very confusing for the users and create chaos on the users' end. This issue could also be solved through the removal of special characters from user input, adding code such as: &lt; username = username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); &gt; under the HTTP POST '/submit' section of the source code. 

<br><br>In another potential security risk found in the source code itself, the application resource has its Access-Control-Allow-Origin set to * in both the post /submit and get /vehicle.json sections of the code, which allows any site to send XHR requests to the site and access the response of the server. The severity of this issue is a medium because this can allow for CSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks to the server of the web application. However, finding a solution to this issue is difficult because in order for The Black Car Service to work, it must be able to retrieve information from different locations. The design of The Black Car Service can be changed and have the Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow the domain website to access the response data. 

<br><br>Another general risk is the displaying of users' latitudes and longitudes on a public website - doing so gives away the locations of certain passengers and vehicles, and if the username is recognizable, the user can easily be located by anyone who accesses The Black Car Service webpage at https://fierce-temple-31110.herokuapp.com. The severity of this issue is a high, because anyone has access to this webpage and can retrieve users' immediate locations.This issue could be solved by changing the design of the service so that only vehicles looking for passengers can access that information, rather than displaying it on a wepbpage that anyone can access. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Black Car Service is a useful service, but has major security and privacy issues, especially in how vulnerable it is to cross site scripting and injection attacks. It is recommended that these issues be resolved using the solutions above before advancing with the deveolpment of this service. </p>
