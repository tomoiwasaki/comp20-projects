Assignment 2: The Black Car Service

All aspects of this project have been properly implemented. The map displays
every passenger/vehicle, and upon clicking on each icon, displays their 
username and how far away in miles they are from the user. Vehicles and
passengers have different icons to differentiate themselves from each other,
and the page is able to handle both statuses of being a driver (looking for
passengers) and of being a passengers (looking for vehicles). The user's
location is also given a custom marker. I did, however, use two info windows
instead of one, one for vehicles/passengers and one for the user, despite 
the hint that was given to us in the assignment. 

Every custom marker image I used were retrieved from the following sites: 
red star icon: http://www.iconsdb.com/red-icons/star-icon.html
vehicle icon: https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a2.html
passenger icon: https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/41989/passenger_taxi_icon

I spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment.
